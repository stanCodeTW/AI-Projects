I bought an Apple Watch two years ago, I'm loving it and I've spent these two yearsperfectingmy collection of Apple Watch faces. I currently have 30-ish official Apple Watch faces, which is without using any third party apps. Apple has really opened my eyes to a completely new interest in color and color theory. I'm obsessing over it but haven't seen anywhere on the internet where anyone seems to care much about it at all, which feels hopeless. I thought that maybe at Macrumors if anywhere someone might be interested in hearing me out.Anyway, in this thread I want to test whether sharing using thumbnails and links works alright:DaybreakMy January Apple Watch Face of the Month! Hitting Daybreak should probably offer to install it. The Gradient watch face is one of the greatest and looks awesome with or without complications. I usually avoid complications except the Today complication. I think a lot of users don't know the Gradient watch face supports a top complication. Style III keeps the color in always-on mode.

I was looking at it today and I realized the area of irritation had nothing to do with the watch band but this case. Its design on the sensor side of the AW covered all but the sensors. it was this part of the case that was causing the irritation. When I removed this case the inside was rather dirty. I wipe this watch off whenever I have is off this was not good. I had ordered another case for this Ultra 2. This one has a lock for the button that is used to call emergency services, it easily snaps back-n-forth but is prevents the button from being touched and 911 accidentally being called.

Just tell them you lost your light grey band that comes exclusively with the S7 Titanium Watch, you contact Apple Store and they tell you it's not a retailing product but chat support may help by requesting a replacement part, yes replacement part is the keyword.Then the advisor will ask you several unrelated stupid questions for example the watchOS version, how long do you wear your watch a day, I guess they are requested by Apple to fill those answers, the serial of the S7 Ti Watch.Finally, after confirmation of the correct band you want, they will send you an email including a button where you can pay the replacement part, fill in the shipping info.

I do not do yard work or gardening all the time but I do wear my Apple Watch everyday and even to do chores. The stainless steel Apple Watch and all other watches that come in more expensive materials like titanium/ceramic Apple Watch Editions and the Apple Watch Ultra use a sapphire crystal screen that does not scratch as easily as a aluminum case would.I had my SS Apple Watch for about two months to replace my worn out space gray Apple Watch Series 1 of seven years, so far there are ZERO SCRATCHES on my Apple Watch through this time. My previous Apple Watch Series 1 already got scratched on the screen at that same time when I got it in 2017, so that proves how the stainless steel versions have special coating and a more premium screen than the aluminum ones present in the Apple Watch SE and the mainline Apple Watch models. BTW I never use a case on my Apple Watch unless if I have to use heavy machinery like a lathe or CNC, or to hide away screen separation which my Apple Watch Series 1 ended up after going through wear and tear for many years, including reduced battery life.A standard stainless steel Apple Watch that is NOT GOLD, GRAPHITE OR SPACE BLACK can be repolished back to its original shiny color with stainless steel polishing cloths like Cape Cod, or at a local jewelry store. I keep a Crizal glasses polishing cloth to wipe down my Apple Watch and my iPhone regularly, and it helps remove smudges on the stainless. \n","Response: Review 1: positive\n","\n","Review 45622: I use a hydrogel screen protector on my series 9 which is totally unnoticeable, as you can see from some of the pictures I posted, there is no touch sensitivity loss and its been on there for months and I havent had to replace it yet.As far as scratches on the body, youre correct in saying that scratches can be removed with the Cape Cod cloth at least on the stainless steel. \n","Response: Review 2: positive\n","\n","Review 45623: Fair enough, sir. I used to have these hydrogel wet screen protectors for my previous Apple Watch Series 1 38mm space grey, but it collected bubbles and gunk from dusty surfaces so easily that I could not stand it, so I stopped using them. I do not use cases on my SS Apple Watch as it defeats the purpose of showcasing its shine and glory, and after workouts and going in the pool, it turns very crusty on the clear cases. I also seen curved screen protectors that are in tempered glass that can serve as a similar effect but without the worries that film can collect so much more dust. \n","Response: Review 3: negative\n","\n","Review 45624: THANK YOU for the REPLY, very informative.

I totally am the human Apple intelligence person if one asks Siri about their Apple Watch, iPhone, iPad and iPod. Especially their Mac. 儭Now on to the stainless steel and titanium ones. A gold Apple Watch existed originally as the Apple Watch Edition that was overrated and overpriced at $10K+, for an 18 karat real gold Apple Watch. It got phased out when the Apple Watch series 2 came out and ceramic made it reduced to the price a tad bit above stainless steel. Only thing is that though more people bought it, the Apple Watch Edition in ceramic lasted until the last iteration of original Apple Watch design as the Apple Watch Series 3 with a gray ceramic option, which the white ceramic is the only Apple Watch Edition in ceramic that used the modern era casings, which is the Apple Watch Series 5 that simultaneously introduced the second titanium Apple products, Apple Card being the first. The Apple Watch Edition in titanium S5-7 was the longest running of the premium material lineup besides stainless steel, with the Space Black titanium matching the present-day iPhone 15 Pro black titanium. The silver titanium matches the iPhone 15 Pro in natural and silver titanium, which once it got phased out after Apple Watch Series 7, it became the more rugged and tactical version of the Apple Watch Ultra, in line with the Apple Watch Series 8.The gold stainless steel had two tones of gold, which can also be a sign of what series it is. If it resembles nearly a rose gold that matches an iPhone XS or iPhone 11 Pro, it is an Apple Watch Series 4 and 5. If it is the same size as these two but as a yellow gold like the iPhone 14 Pro to 12 Pro, it is a S6; more obvious physical signs are visible in S7-9 include a fuller screen, single cutout of the speaker.Graphite and space black is obvious signs of series, as well. Space black can be harder to distinguish as it is still existent as a Hermes exclusive, but graphite is not part of Herm癡s Apple Watch. A graphite Apple Watch uses a space gray-like tone of stainless steel plating and is an Apple Watch Series 6 or later, following any visible changes to the speaker slots and screen sizes. \n","Response: Neutral\n","\n","Review 45767: Black and gray striped woven nylon on SBSS \n","Response: \n","\n","Review 45768: Good morning Apple Watch wearers, I hope you are having a wonderful day yall.

I owned a Pebble Watch prior to the Apple Watch, and it was basically limited to managing calls and receiving notifications. Apple went ahead with the Apple Watch because they saw the opportunity to do something more with the deep level of system-level integration they had access to (and charge handsomely for it). Imagine an alternate reality where Apple never bothered with releasing the Apple Watch because they realised that legislation like the DMA would simply force Apple to make available to competitors all the progress they had made with their R&D, and there would be no ROI in this regard. We would not have the Apple Watch Ultra 2 today, and would still be counting steps and syncing notifications with Fitbit trackers.What incentive would there be for Apple to keep innovating if they are obligated to now share those innovation with its competitors? Everyone would just sit back, wait for Apple to release a new product category like AirPods or the Apple Watch, then copy it and undercut Apple because they now no longer need to spend on R&D themselves, knowing that it would just work as well anyways.Or let's use Spotify (the EU's darling poster child) as another example. Maybe it is \"cheating\" that Siri can only be used to stream music on Apple Music, but if you give me the option between being able to do only this, and not even having said option (because Apple would rather not let you control Spotify in this manner), I fail to see how consumers are better off by not having even one superior alternative, if it locks them in to Apple's platform, and even if it does disadvantage every other alternative. At least I have the option of paying for an integrated experience, unlike with Android or Windows.Like, would you be happy only when I can't even use Siri to start music playback or dictate messages on a cellular Apple Watch just because you currently can't do likewise with Spotify or WhatsApp? That's what you all basically believe, right? That Apple somehow has to suffer and to lose in order for consumers to win, whereas in reality, I find that our incentives are more closely aligned than most here would care to believe.\"Unfair\" is nothing more than a meaningless buzzword used by companies looking for someone to blame for market failures when the problem is (more often than not) found internally with a bad vision, inadequate corporate culture, and lack of understanding as to what makes Apple unique. \n","Response: neutral\n","\n","Review 45994: The argument can easily be reversed:What incentive is there for other potential smartwatch manufacturers to keep innovating - if they can't compete with Apple anyways, due to being locked out of interoperability?We're now living in a world where hardly anyone will invest in R&D for smartwatches - and people are fooling themselves if they believe that only Apple can make \"the best\" watches.Furthermore andover the longer term, what incentive is there for Apple to invest into their own smartwatch line and come up with real innovations - when they can just \"go through the motions\" of delivering only incremental updates.

For example. Apple have one real choice. Apple music. They pay (apple, somewhat surprisingly) to get music. Thats OK. A good service. Spotify and others also exist, but its awkward.

No restrictions.Dont you, the ios user, feel a tad hard done by? \n","Response: neutral\n","\n","Review 46206: They matter because choice is important. They can't achieve the same notoriety because they're not built in, they receive less preferential treatment and they're overshadowed by massive google influence and subsequent steering. \n","Response: Negative\n","\n","Review 46207: No, I don't. Would I prefer Apple offer some things that they don't or change some policies? Absolutely. Do I think government should come in and force them to offer or change them? Absolutely not. If they bother me enough, I'll switch to Android. Because, despite what the EU and DMA defenders keep arguing, there is plenty of competition in smartphones and switching is not hard or expensive. \n","Response: neutral\n","\n","Review 46208: Fair enough. Opinions are valid. Contrary to what you suggest though, it is hard to switch. Get your notes out of the notes app, transfer your app settings between the two OS's, export/import everything from one os to the other without a hitch and get back to me. When that day comes, without intervention, we will all be robots. With intervention, perhaps we will see it in our lifetimes.I just dont think this power is a power that should be able to be wielded. I admit its come from a good place, it probably didn't intend to be intentional. Probably.

For example in the eastern part of the US we have QuickCheck and WAWA gas stations. If there was a small town that only had two gas stations and they were QuickCheck and WAWA it could rightfully be said there was a duopoly. That there is this \"duopoly\" is not necessarily bad unless the two gas stations collude on a price fixing scheme or other such illegal activities or somehow figure out how to restrict competition illegally in this small town. If this happens the pro-antitrust folks do have a point.But imo, this does not apply to the ios vs android app store debate because of the rational I posted above, even if some don't agree with it. It seems the app store marketplace between this \"duopoly\" is rife with competition. Although some still call the ios app store a monopoly there hasn't been any case law validating this. Hence to side-step this issue the DMA was created.It has been said apple violated anti-trust laws. It's true there was a finding from one of the eight or nine points in the Epic vs Apple lawsuit. They won on 8 and lost one 1. (The least important one) That's life in corporate America. I could probably go down the list of fortune 100 companies and find something, anything they did and received a judgement in a court of law. The punishment for Apple, they now have to allow verbiage saying where the service can be purchased elsewhere.After all of these posts, no one will ever change anyones' mind. The anti-trust, pro-DMA group hails the legislation, while the folks who want less, not more, governmental regulations decry the regulation.Just a typical day on the MR website. \n","Response: neutral\n","\n","Review 46216: Funny how noone is arguing that desktop OSes are basically a duopoly for consumers...And the same hinderances exist to stop you moving from one platform to another.It might be your work dictates the hardware choice.It might be once you buy software for one, you dont get a licence to use it on the other so you cant swap over.Sure you can install anything you like and run it (with warnings sometimes) but even then, there is not the freedom to just jump OSes.Then software has to evolve with the hardware.All the 32 bit stuff that wont run anymore.All the M chip specific Apple code.I even tried moving a Time Machine backup from an old Intel Apple to another Intel Apple laptop running a later version of OS and it failed to run Parallels in the new OS.The IT world is filled with examples of limits.The iOS setup was designed one way from day one. You bought the device knowing that.But those who \"love iOS\" but still want it to bend to their self-centred needs are not really loving the core ideals of iOS.
