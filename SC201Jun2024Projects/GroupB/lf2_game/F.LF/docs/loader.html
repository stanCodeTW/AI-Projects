# loader.js
### Reference

loader is a requirejs plugin that loads content packages. the specification of F.LF content packages is defined in [package](package.html)

## Usage

```
requirejs(['LF/loader!path/to/package'],function(){...});
```

## mechanism

#### 1 flf-config
loader expects that a flf-config element exists in the html document. it is a `<pre>` tag with id `flf-config` containing a JSON data structure:
```
<pre id='flf-config' style='display:none'>
{"root":"../","package":"../LF2_19"}
</pre>
```
- root is the project root relative to the html file
- package is the location of content package, it can be relative to root, or at a remote location

#### 2 load package
`manifest.js` under the package directory is loaded. package content is then loaded afterwards.

#### 2.1 load data
load the specified data list, typically named `data.js`.

##### data loading
in `data.js` every object that has a `file` property will have the file loaded, which the file must be a valid [javascript data file](package.html#data_file_format) with a `.js` extension. the file path is relative to the root of the package. When the file is loaded, the data itself will be appended to the original object. for example:
```
/*before*/
data.js:
{
	object:
	[
		{id:1, type:'character', file:'path/to/hero.js'},
		...
	]
}
/*after*/
loaded data:
{
	object:
	[
		{id:1, type:'character', file:'path/to/hero.js', data:{/*content of hero.js appears here*/}},
		...
	]
}
```

##### lazy loading
if `loader_config.lazyload` is defined, every object defined by `data.js` will be passed to `loader_config.lazyload`, and `loader_config.lazyload` shall return `true` if it wants to __not__ load the data file at this moment. the `data` property of that object will then be marked `'lazy'` in this case. if `loader_config.lazyload` returns falsy or `loader_config.lazyload` is not defined, the data file will be loaded immediately.

```
loader_config.lazyload = function(folder,O)
{
	if( folder==='object' && O.type==='character')
		return true; //delay loading of all character files
}
```

later, if the data files are wanted, one should call for example
```
package.data.load({'object':[1,2],'background':[1]}, //wants to load object with id 1 and 2, and background with id 1
function ()
{
	//all data is ready now
});
```

#### 2.2 load resourcemap
if defined, load the specified resourcemap, typically named `resourcemap.js`.

#### 3 return
the loader plugin is __blocking__, and will only return when all data files are loaded.
```
/*loaded module*/
{
	"data": {/*data tree*/},
	"resourcemap": {/*content of resourcemap.js*/}
}
```
