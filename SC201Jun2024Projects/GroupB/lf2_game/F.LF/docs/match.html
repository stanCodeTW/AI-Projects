# match
Match processes all livingobjects sequentially. Tasks like creating new objects will occur occasionally and are scheduled after the end of a frame cycle.

Sometimes livingobjects can interfere and cause each others to transit to a certain frame. If `transition` is not separated from `TU`, late processes will be unable to cause any change to earlier processes; in this case, the earlier processes will gain tactical benefit. The following diagram demonstrates the problem (sprite courtesy Bandit from LF2).
